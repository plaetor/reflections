When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when you may need to work on a project from separate machines like a home
    computer and a work one, or even when a project has more than one contributor. 
    it can also help to use as a backup in case the local machine develops a fault.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    it allows you to chose a point at which it would be apprpriate to pull changes
    rather than automatic pulls which may take place when the changes that have been
    made are incomplete and therefore would not make any sense. it also allows you to
    pull logically complete changes instead of chunks which may not make any sense.
